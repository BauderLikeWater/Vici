Play Instructions:

The goal of Vici is to have conquered all territories on the map. Units and Territories 
can be given targets to attack by selecting them with left click, then selecting 
any space on the map. Territories with a given target will automatically send newly
generated units to their target. To select multiple units at once, hold left click and drag.
On Windows and MacOS, you can hold Left Control or Left Command, respectively, while selecting
to add units to your original selection. Right click will clear your selection. 

     For single-player mode:
     - Select Quick Play from the Play screen.

     For multi-player mode:
     - To join a game, select Multiplayer from the Play screen, then select Join.
       Ask the game host for their IP. Depending on their network setup, you may need to
       add port 8001 to the end of their IP when input. For example, IP address "10.0.0.1"
       may require being input as "10.0.0.1:8001".
     - To host a game, you will need to port-forward port 8001 on your network router. Instructions
       to do this can typically be found in your router's manual. Select Host from the Play -> Multiplayer
       screen. Your IP will be displayed in the upper right-hand corner. Other players looking to join
       your game will need this address to connect.
